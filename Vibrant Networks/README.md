Apologies that I have not organized this better.

ImputedData solves data non-disclosure and noise infusion in CBP data.
ConcordanceNAICS concords all the CBP data to current NAICS codes.
EmpEnt Matrices creates distance matrices from the CBP data.

IOData creates distance matrices from BEA I/O data.

Occ_data creates distance matrices from Occupation Composition data.

Combo_matrix puts it all together.

KNN handles the modified K-Nearest Neighbor analysis.

Master_Table formats output.


I will try to better organize the other files and provide more details about what they do. The names should be descriptive.
